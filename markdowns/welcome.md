# Welcome!

This Spring 5 template lets you get started quickly with a simple working example using Maven and JUnit. A first example of rest service is provided. If it is your first contribution then you should have a look at the [Getting Started](https://tech.io/doc/getting-started-create-playground) document.


The source code is on [GitHub](https://github.com/TechDotIO/Spring5-template), please feel free to come up with proposals to improve it.

# Hands-on Demo
